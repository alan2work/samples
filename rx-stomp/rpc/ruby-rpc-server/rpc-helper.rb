require 'logger'

###############################################################################
# A sophisticated RPC server framework.
#
# It supports the following:
#
# * You can pass a thread_pool which is instance of `Thread.pool` provided
#   by gem `thread`.
# * If you set `manual_ack` in `subscribe_opts`, it will take care of
#   `ack` for successful response. In case of any Exceptions, it will `reject`.
# * It supports `logger`, you can pass an instance to customize logging.
# * It should be considered production ready, please raise issues if you
#   find any cases which are not covered.
#
# See rpc-server-thread-pool.rb for usage sample
